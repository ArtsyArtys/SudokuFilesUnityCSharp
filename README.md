# SudokuFilesUnityCSharp
  The beginning of my first soon-to-be published mobile app, created with the Unity game engine and programmed in C#.
  Currently only showing certain files as version control is maintained by Unity's version control system. The main purpose of putting these files on github is to share the calendar creation and sudoku grid generator implementation with C#. Version 1.0.0 will be coming out soon on the Google Play Store, and the Apple Store.
